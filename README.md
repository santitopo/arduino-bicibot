# arduino-bicibot

The proposed challenge was to create an innovative product using an Arduino board plus some sensors, without any previous knowledge of the framework.  
The chosen product was a speed and distance tracker that can be installed on any bike. 
By letting the Arduino program know the radius of the wheel, the program can measure the distance and keep track of the speed.

MVP developed using:
- Arduino board
- Hall sensor (Magnetic field)
- LCD screen
- USB battery
- Magnet
